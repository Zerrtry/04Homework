https://zerrtry.github.io/04Homework/

To start the quiz, the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button on the landing page.

Once the quiz is started, the user is presented with a question, along with 4 possible answers. Upon clicking one of the possible answers, the app will tell the user whether their answer was correct or not, deduct 10 seconds from the remaining time if incorrect, then load the next question.

Once the final question is answered, the user's final score is shown, and a app is given for the user to enter their initials. When the "Submit" button is clicked, the initials and score are saved to new element on the HTML page. The list of saved scores can be seen by clicking the "View High Scores" button.
